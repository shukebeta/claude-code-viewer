# 🔍 Claude Code Viewer

Claude Code Viewer is a desktop application for viewing and analyzing Claude Code CLI session logs. It provides a graphical interface for session transcripts, rendering conversations with markdown, syntax-highlighted code blocks, and formatted tool outputs.

## 💡 Why Claude Code Viewer?

Working with Claude in the terminal is powerful, but long sessions can become hard to navigate. Claude Code Viewer bridges this gap by providing a visual interface that makes your sessions readable and manageable.

**The workflow is simple:**
- Use Claude in your terminal for coding
- Pop open the viewer with `ccviewer` to see the full conversation beautifully formatted
- Copy session commands from the viewer to continue where you left off
- Jump between terminal and viewer seamlessly

Think of it as your session's reading glasses - everything becomes clearer when you need to review what happened, understand complex outputs, or share your work with others.
